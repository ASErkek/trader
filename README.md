# trader

This project includes experimental mobile app development. 

In this project, it is aimed to create a platform that enables the investor to track whether their investments are in profit or loss, and to find the bank where they can evaluate their investment highest.

Please note t that there is also a back-end code that automatically updates the banks' rates. This code is in the investor-server github repository.
